# Ready to move to Toronto?
>This project is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nano-degree Program to write a data science blog post.

#### Project Motivation:
Being a former Torontonian, I had an amazing life in Toronto as an international graduate student. Through this post, I want to help people who are considering to move to Toronto make an informed decision as they choose a certain place to live in the city. That is why I will try to answer the following questions:
* What are the most popular neighborhoods in Toronto?
* What are the best affordable neighborhoods to live in?
* What are the common amenities offered in Toronto's listings?

#### Installations:
- Python3
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib


#### Files Descriptions:
1. TO_airbnb_analysis.ipynb : a jupyter notebook illustrating the data analysis of the project.
2. TO_detailed_listings_data : CSV file contating a dataset provided by Airbnb with all the basic information.

#### Analysis Observations:
* Most popular neighborhoods in TO are: Rustic, Markland Wood, Playter Estates-Danforth, The Beaches, Eringate-Centennial-West Deane, Trinity-Bellwoods, Forest Hill South, Waterfront Communities-The Island, Yonge-Eglinton, and Kingsway South.
* Most expensive neighborhoods in TO are: Rustic, Woburn, Yonge-St.Clair, Forest Hill South, Waterfront Communities-The Island, Leaside-Bennington, Bathurst Manor, Maple Leaf, Kingsway South, and Niagara.
* Most affordable neighborhoods in TO are: Malvern, Glenfield-Jane Heights, Eglinton EastSteeles, Caledonia-Fairbank, Pleasant View, Black Creek, York University Heights, Mount Olive-Silverstone-Jamestown, and Keelesdale-Eglinton West.
* Location popularity is not necessarily related to proximity from Toronto Downtown since most popular neighborhoods are scattered all around the Great Toronto Area (GTA).Reasons for popularity varies from one neighborhood to another. Sometimes it is the Lake Ontario view, such as The Beaches and Waterfront Communities. Sometimes it is the luxury life style, such as Yonge-Eglinton.
* However, location is a primary contributor to the high rent prices. For example, Yonge-St.Clair, Waterfront Communities, and Maple Leaf are expensive due to their close proximity to Toronto Downtown. Not to mention Niagara and its stunning location overlooking Niagara Falls. On the other hand, locations with most affordable rent prices are literally scattered around the edges of the Great Toronto Area (GTA).
* There are about 437650 amenities offered in Toronto Airbnb listings.
* The top 10 in-demand amenities are: Wifi, Heating, Smoke alarm, Essentials, Kitchen, Air conditioning, Hangers, Carbon monoxide alarm, Washer, and Dryer.
